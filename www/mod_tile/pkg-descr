mod_tile is a system to serve raster tiles, for example to use with a slippy map

The system is split into two parts:

- mod_tile - A custom Apache module which is responsible for serving tiles and
             requests the rendering of tiles if they aren't already available
             in cache or if they have changed since.
- renderd - A rendering back-end, that takes requests from mod_tile, and
            renders them to the file system. It is also responsible for
            queueing requests to ensure the server is not overloaded if many
            requests come in simultaneously.
